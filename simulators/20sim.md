# 20-Sim
20-sim is a modeling and simulation program for mechatronic systems. With
20-sim you can enter model graphically, similar to drawing an engineering
scheme. With these models you can simulate and analyze the behavior of
multi-domain dynamic systems and create control systems. You can even generate
C-code and run this code on hardware for rapid prototyping and HIL-simulation.
More information is available on the 20-sim website [here](http://www.20sim.com/).


## FMI/FMU support for 20-sim
FMI support for INTOÂ­-CPS is built-in starting with 20-sim 4.6.

For 20-sim 4.5, the FMI support is provided using a separate code generation
template that can be downloaded from our Github repository
[here](https://github.com/controllab/fmi-export-20sim).

Installation instructions can be found in the
[README](https://github.com/controllab/fmi-export-20sim/blob/master/README.md)
available in the Github repository.
