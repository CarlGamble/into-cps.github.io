# Co-Simulation

A simulation starts by defining the connection between FMU instances at the system modelling level. This is then used to start the COE.

1. Define connections in SysML
2. Export the SysML model to the INTO-CPS App as a configuration file
3. Start the COE

This assumes that all FMUs has been developed in one of the Simulators and exported prior to this.
