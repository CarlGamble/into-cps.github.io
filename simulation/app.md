# APP


The INTO-CPS Application is the front-end of the INTO-CPS tool chain.  The following screenshot shows how it looks.

![1]

Taking as input a configuration mapping and FMUs, the INTO-CPS Application
allows you to construct a multi-model and execute it in a co-simulation
orchestrated by the COE.

The app is composed of 2 primary views: On the left, the project browser left
is always visible. It shows the various components of an INTO-CPS project.
These components can be clicked to trigger various actions. In the center, the
main view is shown. The contents of this view depend on which action has
been trigerred in the project browser. A few example views are shown below.
