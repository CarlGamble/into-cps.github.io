# Known issues:
1. VSI-TOOLCHAIN: To run RTT-UI3 you must go to the "bin" folder in the
    installation directory and launch the tool by double clicking on the
    "rttui3.exe" executable there. Running it via e.g. the Start Menu doesn't
    work. A fix for this is expected soon in the next release (3.8.1) of the
    tool.
