# Overview

The Integrated Tool Chain for Model-based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems (INTO-CPS) is an integrated “tool chain” for comprehensive Model-Based Design (MBD) of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The tool chain supports multidisciplinary, collaborative modelling of CPSs from requirements, through design, down to realisation in hardware and software. This enables traceability at all stages of the development.

The full project description can be found at: [into-cps.au.dk](http://into-cps.au.dk/).

This page are used as a distribution medium for the project releases of the INTO-CPS technology developed during the project execution. The bar at the left hand-side of the wiki pages can be used to navigate to the desired parts of the INTO-CPS technology that one would like to get hold of. This includes updates to all baseline tools.
